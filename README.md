## Deployed Application 
https://jasonluxie.github.io/4-1-project-1/

## Description
Application checks if you own the current free game on the Epic games store on steam. 

## Notes
Steam keys are bound to profile, so you can only use my user ID at the moment.

## Future Development
* Try to obtain key to access all public accounts on steam instead of having keys be assigned to individual accounts.
